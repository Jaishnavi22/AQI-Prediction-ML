- File used: city_day.csv

## Features Used
- PM2.5
- PM10
- NO2
- SO2
- CO
- O3

## Target
- AQI

## Algorithm
- Linear Regression

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies
3. Run `aqi_prediction.py`

## Results
The model achieved reasonable accuracy with a Mean Squared Error around 1000, suitable for a beginner ML project.
